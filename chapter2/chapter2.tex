In this chapter I explain how the LIGO detectors work.

\section{Arms, cavities, etc}

The purpose of the LIGO detectors is to measure the faint
oscillations of spacetime imparted by far-away astrophysical
processes.  Through clever design and careful engineering, these
machines are capable of resolving these tiny perturbations from the
much louder sea of noise on the surface of the Earth.

As we have seen, a passing gravitational wave modulates the optical
path length of light passing between inertial test
masses.  To exploit this effect and build a detector around it, we
need to arrange to have inertial test masses.  We need to be able to
tell the difference between phase perturbations due to the
gravitational wave and phase perturbations inflicted by our light
source.  We need to eliminate sources of phase variations that would
be louder than the effect we wish to measure.  

The essential points are:
\begin{itemize}
\item We approximate inertial test masses by hanging the optics as
  pendula.  These act as inertial masses above the pendulum resonance.
\item We build a Michelson interferometer for its common-mode noise
  rejection.  This is nicely compatible with the tensor action of
  gravitational waves.
\item To enhance the effect from a passing gravitational wave, we make
  the arms as long as possible.  To further enhance the response, we
  have the light travel this path many times, by using resonant cavities.
\item To increase the optical response to a gravitational wave, we
  increase the light power in the interferometer by using power
  recycling.
\end{itemize}
The following sections describe these principles in further detail.
\section{A Michelson}
\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics{figures/michelson.pdf}
\caption[Michelson interferometer]{\label{fig:michelson}Michelson
  interferometer.  This figure introduces some of the common
  nomenclature for the ports and optics of the Michelson
  interferometer.  ETM stands for `end test mass.'}
\end{figure}

Contemplating the effect of a gravitational wave on a ring of test
particles (figure~\ref{fig:gwave-effect}), it is easy to imagine
constructing a Michelson interferometer (figure~\ref{fig:michelson})
with its beamsplitter in the center of the circle and with two of the
test particles forming the end mirrors of the Michelson.  More
importantly, the Michelson allows us to separate the differential
motion of the two arms from the common motion, which is
indistinguishable from laser frequency changes.

If we assume a perfect (lossless, 50/50) beamsplitter, the
transmission and reflection coefficients for the Michelson are:
%
\begin{align}
t_M  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(r_x \exp \{i2\phi_x\} - r_y \exp\{i2\phi_y\} \right) \\
r_M  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(r_x \exp \{i2\phi_x\} + r_y \exp\{i2\phi_y\} \right)
\end{align}
where $r_{\{x,y\}}$ are the amplitude reflectivities of the x- and y-arm mirrors, and $\phi_{\{x,y\}}$ are 
the phases accumulated as the light travels from the beamsplitter to end mirrors.  It is useful to change
our variables to express these quantities in terms of the differential and common reflectivies and phases.
Make the substitutions
%$\phi_- = \phi_x - \phi_y$ and 
%$\phi_+ = \phi_x + \phi_y$, i.e. 
$\phi_x = (1/2)\left(\phi_+ + \phi_-\right)$
$\phi_y = (1/2)\left(\phi_+ - \phi_-\right)$
%% which gives
%% \begin{align}
%% t_M  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(r_x e^{i2\phi_x} - r_y e^{i2\phi_y} \right) \\
%% r_M  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(r_x e^{i2\phi_x} + r_y e^{i2\phi_y} \right)
%% \end{align}
%%
%% \begin{align}
%% t_M  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(r_x e^{i\left(\phi_+ + \phi_- \right)} - r_y e^{i\left(\phi_+ - \phi_-\right)} \right) \\
%% r_M  &= \frac{1}{2}\left(r_x e^{i\left(\phi_+ + \phi_- \right)} + r_y e^{i\left(\phi_+ - \phi_-\right)} \right) 
%% \end{align}
%%
%% \begin{align}
%% t_M  &= \frac{1}{2} e^{i\phi_+} \left(r_x e^{i \phi_- } - r_y e^{-i \phi_-} \right) \\
%% r_M  &= \frac{1}{2} e^{i\phi_+} \left(r_x e^{i \phi_- } + r_y e^{-i \phi_-} \right) 
%% \end{align}
%%
%% Now we can also separate the arm reflectivity into common and differential reflectivity, using 
and $r_x = (1/2)(r_+ + r_-)$ and $r_y = (1/2)(r_+ - r_-)$:
%
\begin{align}
t_M  &= \frac{1}{2} e^{i\phi_+} \left( r_+ i \sin \phi_- + r_- \cos \phi_- \right)\\
r_M  &= \frac{1}{2} e^{i\phi_+} \left( r_+ i \cos \phi_- + r_- \sin \phi_- \right) 
\end{align}

The intent is for the arm reflectivities to be identical (so $r_- \to
0$), and to operate near the \emph{dark fringe} ($\phi_-\to0$) so that
the input field does not couple directly to the output port
(i.e. $t_M\to0$).  Given this configuration, there are two salient
points concerning gravitational wave detection:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Variations of the differential phase $\phi_-$ \emph{linearly couple} to the \emph{field amplitude} at the output port.
\item Variations of the common phase $\phi_+$ do not couple.
\end{itemize}
%
The field at the output port will thus be sensitive to suitably
polarized graviational waves but insensitive to laser frequency noise.
(An orthogonally polarized gravitational wave, whose strain ellipse is
rotated $45^\circ$, will modulate $\phi_+$ but this detector
sacrifices sensitivity to that polarization in order to gain
common-mode noise immunity.)  

Ultimately, we can not measure optical field amplitudes directly, but
only the power, i.e. the envelope of the optical field, as the field
itself oscillates at at $c/(1064\text{ nm})\approx 300\text{ THz}$,
much too quickly to measure directly.  We compute the power at the
anti-symmetric and reflected ports by taking the squared magnitude of
the field amplitudes.  Using $P_{AS} = P_{BS} \left|t_M\right|^2$ and
$P_{REFL} = P_{BS} \left|r_M\right|^2$:
%
\begin{align}
P_{AS}   &=  \frac{1}{4}P_{BS}\left( {r_+}^2 \sin^2 \phi_- + {r_-}^2 \cos^2 \phi_-\right) \\
P_{REFL} &=  \frac{1}{4}P_{BS}\left( {r_+}^2 \cos^2 \phi_- + {r_-}^2 \sin^2 \phi_-\right) 
\end{align}

The power transmitted through the Michelson at the dark fringe is the
\emph{contrast defect},
%
\begin{equation}
c_d = \frac{P_{AS}}{P_{BS}} = \frac{1}{4}\left(r_-\right)^2.
\end{equation}

The linear relationship between $\phi_-$ and the electric field at the
output port has turned into a quadratic relationship between $\phi_-$
and the output port power.  We will turn to the task of recovering a
linear signal in section~\ref{sec:isc}, but first we will consider
methods to magnify the effect of a gravitational wave on $\phi_-$.

\section{Resonant cavities}

One approach to increasing the phase imparted by the GW to the light
in the arms of the interferometer would be to arrange for the light to
make multiple traversals of the arm length.  This could be in the form
of a delay line (where the optical path makes several zig-zags down
the arm length in a definite number of bounces), or a resonant cavity
(made by facing two partially-transmissive mirrors at each other,
resulting in an effective number of bounces).  Resonant cavities were
chosen for the LIGO arms.  They appear in many other guises within the
detector too, so the general theory is quite useful.

Consider the two-mirror system in Figure~\ref{fig:fabry-perot}, a
Fabry-Perot cavity.  Light entering the cavity will interfere with
light already circulating in the cavity.  If, after making a
round-trip through the interior of the cavity, the circulating light
returns to its original phase (and spatial distribution), constructive
interference will occur and the light will resonate in the cavity.  If
the mirrors have high reflectivity, then the light inside the cavity
will survive for many round-trips inside the cavity. Any deviation from the
required $2\pi$ radians of round-trip phase will be magnified on each
bounce, making Fabry-Perot cavities extremely frequency-selective
devices.

\subsection{Fabry-Perot field equations}
Here I will derive the basic properties of Fabry-Perot cavities, for
simplicity ignoring the spatial distribution of light (which we will
revisit in chapter 4), and its polarization.  Despite these
simplification, the results will have wide applicability.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[]{figures/cavity.pdf}
\caption[Fabry-Perot Cavity]{\label{fig:fabry-perot}Fabry-Perot
  cavity.  When used as an arm cavity, the two mirrors are known as
  the input (ITM) and end (ETM) test masses.  Here $E_0$ indicates the
  amplitude of the incident electric field, $E_r$ the reflected field,
  $E_+$ the forward-going intra-cavity field, etc.}
\end{figure}

We begin by writing down the relationships between the fields at each
interface.  For simplicity, we treat each mirror as a single (thin)
interface.  Let $r_1$ and $t_1$ be the amplitude reflectivity and
transmissivity for the input mirror, and $r_2$ and $t_2$ describe the
output mirror.  I use the phase convention where transmission through
a mirror conveys $90^\circ$ of phase, i.e. a factor of $i$ in the
amplitude:
%
\begin{align}
E_+ &= i t_1 E_0 + r_1 E_- \\
E_- &= r_2 e^{i 2 \phi} E_+ \\
E_t &= i t_2 e^{i \phi} E_+ \\
E_r &= r_1 E_0 + i t_1 E_1
\end{align}
%
Solving these equations algebraically for $E_r$ and $E_t$ in terms of the incident field $E_0$, we find the transmission and reflectivity of the cavity:
%
\begin{align}
t_c \equiv & \frac{E_t}{E_0} = 
         \frac{-t_1 t_2 \exp i\phi}
              {1 - r_1 r_2 \exp i2\phi} \\
r_c \equiv & \frac{E_r}{E_0} = 
         \frac{r_1 - \left({r_1}^2 + {t_1}^2\right)r_2 \exp{i2\phi}}
              {1 - r_1 r_2 \exp i2\phi}
\label{eq:cavity-reflectivity}
\end{align}
%
where $\phi=(2\pi/\lambda)L$ is the phase accumulated by the field as it travels from
the first mirror to the second mirror.  This phase depends on both the
laser wavelength and the distance between the mirrors:\footnote{There is an additional contribution to the phase, the Guoy phase shift, due to geometric effects; this is described in chapter 4.  Also note that some references use the \emph{round-trip} phase rather than the \emph{one-way} phase used here.}
\begin{align}
\phi  & = \pi (\nu / \nu_0) \\
\nu_0 & = c/(2L)
\end{align}
where $\nu=c/\lambda$ is the laser frequency, $L$ is the cavity
length, and $\nu_0$ is the \emph{free spectral range}, which describes
the spacing between adjacent resonances.

\subsection{the cavity pole}
It is often useful to write the cavity reflectivity in the form of a
rational transfer function,
\begin{equation}
r_c(s) = \prod_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac {s-z_n} {s-p_n}
\label{eq:rational-function}
\end{equation}
where $s=i\omega$, $\{z_n\}$ are the zeroes of $r_c(s)$, and $\{p_n\}$
are the poles.  To find the poles and zeroes, make the substitution
$\phi=-is/(2\nu_0)$ and solve for the zeroes of the numerator and
denominator of equation~\ref{eq:cavity-reflectivity} separately.  We find:
\begin{align}
p_n &= - \omega_{fsr} \left(\log\left(r_1 r_2\right) +  i n\right)  & \forall n\in \mathbb{Z}\\
z_n &= + \omega_{fsr} \left(\log\left(r_1/r_2\right) +  i n\right)  & \forall n\in \mathbb{Z}\\
\end{align}
where $\omega_{fsr}=2\pi\nu_0$.

Because this function is periodic in $i\omega$, we can in many
circumstances regard the laser carrier as having a frequency
$\nu=0$ rather than $\nu = n\nu_0$ for some very large $n$.

\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics{figures/cavitypzmap.pdf}
\caption[Pole-zero map of Fabry-Perot cavity reflectivity]{\label{fig:cavpzmap} Pole-zero map of the cavity amplitude
  reflectivity.
  Poles are designated with $\times$ and zeros with
  $\circ$; $r_1$ is the amplitude reflectivity of the input coupler,
  and $r_2$ is the amplitude reflectivity of the output coupler.
  Losses can be lumped into $r_2$.  Notice that the free spectral
  range (angular frequency $\omega_{\textrm{fsr}}$) sets the scale of
  the entire diagram, and the function is periodic in $i\omega$: there
  is an infinite line of poles and an infinite line of zeros.  Two
  limiting cases are worth considering: (1) A critically-coupled
  cavity has $r_1=r_2$, which brings the line of zeros onto the
  imaginary axis. On resonance, $i\omega$ travels through these zeros
  and the cavity reflectivity vanishes.  This models the desired
  behavior of mode cleaner cavities. (2) A maximally over-coupled
  cavity has $r_2=1$, in which case the line of poles and line of
  zeros are equally spaced from the imaginary axis.  This models the
  LIGO arm cavities.  
  The cavity's amplitude transmission has the same poles as the
  reflectivity but no zeros.

\end{figure}

\subsection{phase gain}
Our interest in using Fabry-Perot cavities as the arms of a
gravitational wave detector is in having the light traverse the length
of the arm multiple times, multiplying the effect of any optical path
length perturbations caused by a GW.  We can derive the magnitude of
this \emph{phase gain} by examining how the phase of the light reflected from
the cavity changes as the intra-cavity phase $\phi$ changes, for small
variations from resonance.

Suppose $z(t)=A(t) \exp\{i \phi(t)\}$ is an arbitrary complex-valued
function with amplitude $A(t)$ and phase $\phi(t)$. By taking the
logarithm before taking the derivative, we can separate the amplitude
and phase:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log z(t) = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log A(t)\right) + i \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \phi(t)\right)
= \frac{1}{z(t)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} z(t)
\end{equation}
%
This gives us an expression for the rate of change of the phase of a function:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \arg z(t) = \text{Im} \frac{1}{z(t)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} z(t)
\end{equation}

We can find the phase gain of a Fabry-Perot cavity by applying this expression to the cavity reflectivity as a function of intra-cavity phase, $r_c(\phi)$:
\begin{equation}
\text{phase gain} = \text{Im\ } \frac{r_c'}{r_c}
\end{equation}
where $r_c'(\phi)\equiv(\partial/\partial\phi)r_c(\phi)$.  Furthermore, because the derivative of the amplitude of $r_c$ vanishes on resonance, we can simply take the magnitude of $r_c'/r_c$ rather than the imaginary part.

Another way to calculate the phase gain is to use the rational transfer function expression, equation~\ref{eq:rational-function}.  To model the situation near resonance, we need only consider the nearest pole and zero:
\[
r_c(s) \approx \frac{s - z_0}{s - p_0}
 = \frac{s - \omega_{fsr}\log \left(r_1 / r_2\right)}
        {s + \omega_{fsr}\log \left(r_1 \cdot r_2\right)}
\]
Recall that the phase at frequency $\omega$ imparted by a pole at
frequency $\omega_0$ is $\arctan\left(-\omega/\omega_0\right)$; a zero
at the same frequency subtracts this same phase.  For a maximally
over-coupled cavity (i.e. with $r_2 = 1$), the cavity pole and cavity
zero are equal and opposite, so contribute equal phase ($\arctan$ is
odd).  Use $\omega = 2\nu_0\phi$ to express the detuning phase $\phi$ as an equivalent detuning frequency.

Changing the one-way phase of the arm by $\phi$ results in a phase 
change of
\begin{equation}
\phi_r = 2 \tan^{-1} \left( 2 f_{fsr} \frac{\phi}{\omega_0} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\omega_0$ is the cavity pole.  Taking the derivative, we find the \emph{phase gain}:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \phi_r}{d \phi} = 2 \left[1 + \left(\frac{2 f_{fsr} \phi}{\omega_0}\right)^2 \right]^{-1} \frac{2 f_{fsr}}{\omega_0}
\end{equation}
The phase gain on resonance is $2 f_{fsr} / \omega_0 \approx 140$. This phase gain decreases as we detune the cavity further from resonance, but it is not seriously diminished until the cavity detuning approaches the cavity pole.

\subsection{intra-cavity power buildup}

The power buildup in the cavity is given by 
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_+}{P_{IN}} = \frac{|E_+|^2}{|E_0|^2} = \frac{ T_1}{1 - 2 r_1 r_2 \cos 2\phi+\left(r_1 r_2\right)^2 }
\end{equation} 
which may be re-written (using the identity $\cos2\phi = 1 -
2\sin^2\phi$) as
\begin{equation}
\label{cavity_buildup_eq}
\frac{P_+}{P_{IN}} = \frac{g^2}{1 + F \sin^2 \phi} 
\text{  with  } F = \frac{4 r_1 r_2}{(1 - r_1 r_2)^2}
\text{  and  } g = \frac{t_1}{1-r_1 r_2}
\end{equation} 
where $F$ is the \emph{coefficient of finesse} and $g$ is the
\emph{amplitude gain}.

The form of this expression is often referred to in the literature as
an Airy function, though it is distinct from the well-known special
function of the same name.  Making the small angle approximation
$\sin\phi\approx\phi$ we see that each resonance is locally Lorentzian.

\subsection{finesse ($\mathcal{F}$)}
The tightness of the resonance is quantified as the
\emph{finesse} ($\mathcal{F}$), which is defined as the ratio of the
cavity free spectral range to the full-width-half-max of the
resonance,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} \equiv \frac{\nu_0}{\nu_{\mathrm{FWHM}}}
= \frac{1}{2}\frac{\nu_0}{f_c}
\end{equation}
%
where the FWHM is given by twice the cavity pole ($f_c$).  The finesse is related to the coefficient of finesse ($F$) by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{{\sqrt{\arcsin (1/F)}}} \approx \frac{\pi}{2}\sqrt{F}
\end{equation}where the approximation holds for high-finesse cavities.

The finesse ($\mathcal{F}$) of an optical cavity is analogous to
the quality factor (Q) of an oscillator. The Q factor is the ratio
of the frequency of an oscillator to its full-width-half-max bandwidth;
to compute finesse, the free spectral range (spacing between resonances)
is used instead of the oscillator frequency.



\subsection{coupling}

\section{Michelson with Fabry-Perot arms}

To consider a Michelson interferometer with Fabry Perot cavities for
arms, we can substitute the cavity reflectivity into our Michelson
equations.

It is easier to simply put in the phase gain.

\section{Power recycling}

The Michelson interferometer tuned to a dark fringe for the laser
carrier sends most of the laser power back towards the laser.  Instead
of discarding this power, it can be sent back into the Faby-Perot
Michelson interferometer.  This is done by adding an additional
mirror, the \emph{power recycling mirror}, that forms a resonant
cavity with the rest of the interferometer.  Choosing the reflectivity
of the power recycling mirror to match the effective reflectivity of
the rest of the interferometer makes this cavity critically coupled;
ideally all of the laser carrier is coupled into the interferometer
and very little is reflected.  Most of the light stays in the
interferometer until it is lost to scattering or absorption.

\section{The coupled cavity pole}

We can consider the Fabry-Perot Michelson, or, really, any assembly of
mirrors as a single compound mirror with a complex-valued,
frequency-dependent reflectivity.  In particular, we can model the
power-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson as a three mirror cavity.

The dynamics of three-mirror cavities are treated comprehensively in
chapter 4 of Malik's thesis~\cite{Rakhmanov2000Dynamics}.

To find the transfer function of the coupled cavity, we can simply
substitute the cavity reflectivity function $r_c(\phi)$ given in
equation~\ref{eq:cavity-reflectivity} into itself.  

To find the cavity pole of the combined cavity, a good approximation
results if we first compute the reflectivity of the shorter cavity on
resonance, and substitute this into the expression for the cavity pole.
We get:

\begin{equation}
f_{cc} \approx \frac{1}{2\pi} f_{fsr} \log \left(\frac{r_3 - r_1}{1 - r_1 r_3} r_2\right)
\end{equation}



\section{Interferometer Sensing and Control}
\label{sec:isc}
The laser light incident on the interferometer is phase-modulated at
several frequencies, producing optical sidebands on the laser carrier.
Light extracted from the interferometer at its various ports is
incident on photodiodes; the photodiode signals are demodulated to
produce signals.

\cite{Fritschel2001Readout}


\section{Heterodyne detection}

The initial LIGO detectors were designed to use, as much as possible,
proven technologies.  The proven technique for sensing the
length/frequency mismatch of an optical cavity was the
Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)
technique\cite{Drever1983Laser,Black2001Introduction}, sometimes
called reflection-locking, which can be used to lock the frequency of
a laser to the length of a cavity, or vice versa.

In the basic PDH setup, the laser light incident on a resonant cavity
is first phase-modulated at a frequency well outside of the bandwidth
of the cavity, such that the sidebands are nearly anti-resonant in the
cavity when the carrier is resonant.  For small perturbations (in
laser frequency or cavity length) around this point, the phase of the
reflected carrier changes quickly, while the phase of the reflected
sideband field changes more slowly.  The reflected sideband field may
therefore be used as a local oscillator by which to measure the
carrier phase.

\subsection{The Pound-Drever-Hall technique}

The phase modulation may be expanded in terms of sidebands using the
Jacobi-Anger expansion:\footnote{This expansion comes from the 
generating function 
$\exp\{\frac{1}{2} z \left(t - t^{-1}\right)\} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty t^m J_m(z)$ with $t = \exp \{i \omega t'\}$}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcll}
\exp\{i\Gamma\cos\Omega t\} & = &\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \left(i^n\right) & J_n(\Gamma) \exp\{i n \Omega t\} \\
\exp\{i\Gamma\sin\Omega t\} & = & \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} & J_n(\Gamma) \exp\{i n \Omega t\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Upon reflection from a cavity the phases of the carrier and the two
sidebands will be rotated.  This phase rotation converts the phase
modulation to amplitude modulation, which is observed by the
photodiodes.  Typically, the carrier is held on resonance, where there
is a very large change in reflected phase for a small change of
detuning; the sidebands, on the other hand, are typically far from
resonance and experience very little phase change.

The reflectivity of a lossless Fabry-Perot cavity is:
\begin{equation}
r_c = \frac{r_1 - r_2 \exp i2\phi}{1 - r_1 r_2 \exp i 2\phi}
\end{equation}

Suppose the carrier and upper and lower sidebands are incident upon this
cavity, and the reflection from the cavity is incident on a photodiode.
If the cavity length is $L$ and the optical frequency is $\nu$ then
$\phi = (2\pi)(L/c)\nu$.  The sideband detunings are offset from this by
$\pm(2\pi)(L/c)\Omega$.  So, as a function of detuning, we have:
%
\begin{equation}
E_r = J_0 r_c(\phi) 
+ J_1 r_c(\phi - (2\pi L/c)\Omega) 
+ J_1 r_c(\phi + (2\pi L/c)\Omega)
\end{equation}

\section{Determination of LIGO cavity lengths and mirror reflectivities}

The lengths of cavities and reflectivities of mirrors in LIGO are all
driven by a small number of design decisions.  This section is
intended to be a brief and friendly derivation of some of these
values.  Definitive references are \cite{LigoFreqResponse97} or
\cite{Fritschel2001Readout}; A more general reference is
\cite{S5InstrumentPaper}.

As in the preceeding sections, I simply use the plane-wave
approximation for fields inside cavities. This introduces certain
inaccuracies, as, for example, I ignore gouy phase. Nonetheless,
comparison to the actual dimenions of LIGO shows good agreement.

It is useful to draw a distinction between macroscopic and microscopic
lengths. Macroscopic lengths are those derived here and
used in detector engineering, with magnitudes ranging from kilometers
down to centimeters or millimeters. Microscopic lengths are those
on the order of the wavelength of light and smaller, sometimes \emph{much}
smaller. Microscopic lengths are never determined explicitly; instead
they are controlled by servo systems to hold cavities on resonance.
When we say that a cavity is a certain macroscopic length, we retain
the freedom to adjust the microscopic length to attain resonance.

\subsection*{Arm length}

How big a detector can you build? The physical length of the detector
sets the conversion between displacement and strain. Simply making the
detector longer will make any fixed displacement noises into smaller
strain noises-so we want the detector as large as possible. How big
one can build is usually a result of geography, money, and politics.
LIGO got
%
\begin{equation}
\boxed{{L_{+}=4000\text{{\ meters}}}}
\end{equation}

The cavity length determines the free-spectral-range:
%
\begin{equation}
\nu_0\equiv\frac{c}{2L_{+}}\approx37.5\text{ kHz}
\end{equation}



\subsection*{Bandwidth}

In the Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer design, there is a trade-off
between the detector's sensitivity and its bandwidth.\footnote{Advanced LIGO will include an additional mirror, a \emph{signal recycling mirror} at the output of the interferometer, forming an additional resonant cavity at the anti-symmetric port.  This cavity allows the interferometer DC sensitivity to be increased without decreasing its bandwidth.}  As the storage
time in the arm becomes longer and longer (either by making the arm
longer, or by increasing its finesse), the sensitivity to gravitational
waves increases commensurately. However, sensitivity to waves whose
period is shorter than the storage time of the arm is attenuated.
Thus there is a trade-off between sensitivity and bandwidth. 
One must choose a bandwidth. LIGO chooses:
%
\begin{equation}
f_{c}=90\text{\ Hz}
\end{equation}

Together, the free spectral range and the arm cavity pole determine
the cavity finesse:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}=\frac{f_{FSR}}{2f_{c}}\approx210
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Test mass reflectivities}

Knowing our desired finesse allows us to choose the mirror reflectivities.
The finesse is uniquely determined by the fraction of circulating
power that remains in the cavity after each roundtrip, which is given
by a product of the mirror reflectivities and $r_{L}=\sqrt{1-L}$
where L represents losses due to scattering, absorption, etc. 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}\approx-\frac{\pi}{\log r_{1}r_{2}r_{L}}
\end{equation}

This relation fixes the product $r_{1}r_{2}$, leaving the ratio $r_{1}/r_{2}$
as a free parameter. This ratio determines the coupling of the cavity,
from maximally over-coupled ($r_{2}\rightarrow1$), to critically
coupled ($r_{1}=r_{2}$), or to cavity at all ($r_{1}\rightarrow1$).
How do we choose the coupling? Intuitively, we want to couple as much
light as possible into the cavity. In one point of view, this is so
there is as much light as possible present inside the cavity to be
phase modulated by the gravitational wave. The power gain inside the
cavity is given by
\[
g^{2}=\frac{1-r_{1}{}^{2}}{\left(1-r_{1}r_{2}\right)^{2}}
\]
To maximize this, we want $r_{1}$ as small as possible, so we make
the ETM as reflective as possible. It turns out that maximal over-coupling
is the way to go. The best super-polished mirrors we could buy have
transmissivities of 10 ppm, which gives
\begin{equation}
r_{2}=\sqrt{{1-10\times10^{-6}}}\approx0.999995
\end{equation}
Solving equation 1, we find:
\begin{equation}
r_{1}\approx0.985
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Power Recycling - Recycling Mirror}

With the Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer tuned to the dark fringe, all
of the light not lost in the arm cavities is reflected back towards
the laser source. To send this light back into the interferometer,
we add a power recycling mirror, which forms a resonant cavity with
the FP Michelson. We choose the reflectivity of the recycling mirror
to make the cavity critically-coupled for the carrier. 

With the Michelson on a dark fringe, the Michelson reflectivity is
given by the cavity reflectivity on resonance:

\begin{equation}
r_{c}=\frac{r_{1}-r_{2}r_L}{1-r_{1}r_{2}r_L}
\end{equation}
where $r_L$ represents losses in the arm cavity.

We choose:
\begin{equation}
r_{RM}{}^{2}=0.97
\end{equation}

\emph{The recycling mirror transmission is chosen to match the losses
of the rest of the system.}

\subsection*{Power Recycling - PRC cavity length}

We need to have some radio-frequency sidebands in order to implement
the heterodyne scheme that is used to control most of the interferometer.
Its frequency is chosen to be several tens of MHz, and to be approximately%
\footnote{If the sideband were perfectly anti-resonant in the arms, then the
first harmonic would be resonant, which is undesirable.%
} anti-resonant in the arm cavities. We choose:

\[
f_{RF}\approx24.5\mathrm{{\ MHz}}
\]


The RF sidebands must fit in the power recycling cavity. The resonant
conditions for the carrier and for the sideband in the PRC are slightly
different. Because the carrier is resonant in the (strongly over-coupled)
arm cavities, it sees a sign flip in reflection from the arms that
is not seen by the sideband. The carrier is actually \emph{anti-}resonant
in the PRC until the arms come into resonance and this extra sign
flip comes into play. The minimum length of the PRC that satisfies
this requirement occurs when the carrier accumulates $\pi$ radians
more phase than the lower sideband over a round-trip traversal of
the cavity. (The upper sideband, in turn, acquires $\pi$ radians
more than the carrier, putting it $2\pi$ above the lower sideband,
making them simultaneously resonant. The carrier gets its final $\pi$
radians on reflection from the over-coupled arm.) Instead of relying
on intuitive arguments, we can write down equations for the conditions
of resonance:

\begin{eqnarray}
\exp \left\{i (2l/c)\omega_{0}  \right\} &=& -1 \\
\exp \left\{i (2l/c)(\omega_{0} \pm \omega_{rf}) \right\} &=& +1
\end{eqnarray}Solving these%
\footnote{Remember the multivaluedness of the logarithm, i.e. $\log1=i2\pi n$
for all integers $n$.%
}, we find a nice relationship between the cavity length and the RF
wavelength $\lambda_{rf}=c/f_{rf}\approx12\text{ meters}$:

\[
2l_{+}=\lambda_{rf}\left(m+\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]
where m is any integer. The length corresponding to $m=0$ is inconveniently
short%
\footnote{I assume this is the reason...%
}, so we choose $m=1$, giving a power recycling cavity length of:

\[
\boxed{{l_{+}=9.18\text{{\ meters}}}}
\]


\emph{The PRC length is set to allow simultaneous resonance of the
carrier and sidebands in the power recycling cavity.}


\subsection*{Schnupp asymmetry}

Now that we have the RF sidebands resonant in the recycling cavity,
we need to get them to the output port. 

A Michelson with identical arms has no frequency selectivity; in principle
even white light would experience bright and dark fringes. Introducing
an offset breaks this degeneracy, as the offset allows higher frequency
waves to accumulate more phase than slower frequencies. Introducing
a macroscopic difference in the arm lengths separates the carrier
fringes from the sideband fringes. In the longer arm, now, the lower
sideband accumulates less phase than the carrier, and the upper sideband
accumulates a bit more. When the beams from the two arms recombine,
the phase difference now depends on the frequency. With such an asymmetry,
the Michelson can be simultaneously reflective of the carrier and
partially transmissive of the sidebands. 

How much sideband transmission do we need? The Michelson is acting
as the second mirror in a resonant cavity. If we want to have perfect
transmission of the sideband to the output port, then the power recycling
cavity must be critically coupled for the sideband. This occurs when
the Michelson transmission of the sideband is equal to the transmissivity
of the RM. This scheme for getting the sideband to the {}``dark'' port is attributed
to Lisa Schnupp, and the offset is called the Schnupp asymmetry.

The Michelson reflectivity for the sideband is:

\begin{equation}
r_{M}=\cos\frac{2\pi f_{rf}l_{-}}{c}
\end{equation}

(The fringe of the lower sideband lags that of
the carrier, and the upper sideband leads the carrier. But because
the carrier itself is on a dark fringe, the transmission of both the
upper and lower sidebands turns out to be the same.)

Solving $r_{M}{}^{2}=0.97$ in order to match the RM, we find a Schnupp
asymmetry of

\begin{equation}
l_{-}=34\text{\ cm}
\end{equation}

\emph{The Schnupp asymmetry sets the coupling of the RF sidebands to the
antisymmetric port.}

\section{Heterodyne shot noise}

I conclude this chapter with a discussion of the shot-noise-limited
sensitivity of a detector using heterodyne readout.

When a constant optical power $P$ is incident upon a photodetector, we
expect to observe Poisson shot noise in the resulting photocurrent.
This shot noise has a white (flat) power spectrum, with amplitude
spectral density $\sqrt{2 P h \nu}$, where $h\nu$ is the energy of an
individual photon.

In the heterodyne readout system, the power on the photodiode is
\emph{not} constant; instead, the power varies sinusoidally at a
frequency $2f_{mod}$ due to the beat between the upper and lower RF
sidebands.  At any given instant, a measurement of the rate of photon
arrival will return a value from the Poisson distribution with mean
$P/(h\nu)$, which has standard deviation $\sqrt{P/(h\nu)}$.  A
measurement of power therefore will give $P\pm\sqrt{h\nu P}$, where
$P$ is varying sinusoidally with time.  This is an example of
cyclostationary noise; a sample realization is depicted in
figure~\ref{fig:cyclostationary-shot-noise}.  When considering a long
time series ($t\gg1/f_{mod}$), the signal will appear to have a noise
floor determined by its average power.  On closer examination,
however, we see that the noise comes in bursts.

The bursty nature of this noise becomes a problem when we consider
demodulation.  Comparing the demodulation waveforms ($\cos 2\pi
f_{mod} t$ and $\sin 2\pi f_{mod} t$) to the envelope of the noise, we
see that one demodulation quadrature systematically samples the
highest variance portions of the timeseries, while the other
quadrature sames the lowest variance portions (see
figure~\ref{fig:cyclostationary-shot-noise}).  The
result\cite{Niebauer1991Nonstationary} is that the shot noise ASD in a
demodulated signal is
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{2h\nu\bar{P} \left( \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\cos2\theta\right)}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{P}$ is the average power on the photodiode and $\theta$ is
the demodulation phase.

The shot noise level in a heterodyne readout is a more subtle matter,
as illustrated by the number of publications on the topic:
\cite{Niebauer1991Nonstationary, Lyons2000Shot, Mio1992Observation, Meers1991Modulation, Buonanno2003Quantum}

\caption[Illustration of cyclo-stationary shot noise]{\label{fig:cyclostationary-shot-noise} \textbf{(a)} Model of
  shot noise in the presence of sinusoidal power modulation, as occurs
  in optical heterodyne detection.  The photodiode sees a power
  modulation at $2f_{mod}$ (white) due to the beat between the upper
  and lower modulation sidebands at $f_{carrier} \pm f_{mod}$.
  The gray levels represent the $1\sigma,\ 2\sigma,
  \cdots, 5\sigma$ ranges for a Poisson distribution.  The blue dots
  are a sample realization of this noise. \textbf{(b)} Subtracting the
  mean from (a) leaves only the noise; its bursty nature is obvious.
  Shown in black and red are the I and Q demodulation waveforms,
  respectively.  It is clear that the in-phase demodulation (I)
  samples regions of the time series with higher variance than the
  quadrature phase (Q).  This leads to a higher variance (shot noise
  level) in the I signal and a lower one in the Q signal relative to
  what one would expect from a na\"ive assumption based on the average
  power considered over a whole period of the waveform.}
