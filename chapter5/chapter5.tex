\chapter{DC Readout Performance and Noise Couplings}
\label{chapter5}

The coupling of noises from the laser source and RF oscillators to the
gravitational wave readout channel differ considerably in RF and DC
readouts.  In addition, the combination of DC readout with an OMC
introduces a greater sensitivity to beam motion (jitter).  These
couplings are of primary interest in designing the optical readout of
a gravitational wave detector.  

In this chapter, I sketch the technique for calculating expected noise
couplings analytically and numerically, and I will present
measurements of these noise coupling measurements made on the two
Enhanced LIGO interferometers.  I compare the expected and achieved
shot-noise-limited sensitivity, verifying that the fundamental and
technical shot noise improvements due to homodyne detection and the OMC
are realized.

\section{Sensitivity}

The primary figure of merit of a gravitational wave detector is its
noise floor, calibrated as a strain spectral density; the noise floor
is often referred to as simply the \emph{sensitivity} (despite a lower
noise floor indicating better sensitivity).  When evaluating DC
readout in Enhanced LIGO, we can begin by looking at the noise floor:
do we understand the achieved sensitivity?  At low frequencies
($f\lesssim200\text{ Hz}$), the interferometer noise floor is limited
by displacement noises which will be independent of any readout, while
at high frequencies, the noise floor is set by shot noise.  The
shot-noise-limited sensitivity of a power-recycled interferometer
using DC readout is given by a small number of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item the length of the arm cavities ($L = 3995$ m)\\ or,
  equivalently, the free spectral range ($\nu_0 = c/(2L)$)
\item the input power to the interferometer ($P_{IN}$)
\item the power recycling gain ($g_{cr}^2$)
\item the arm cavity finesse ($\mathcal{F} = 220$)
\item the input and output efficiency ($\epsilon$)
\item the laser wavelength ($\lambda = 1064\times10^{-9}$ m)
\end{itemize}
where we lump all losses due to absorption, scattering, or imperfect
mode-matching, and the photodiode quantum efficiency, into the efficiency
$\epsilon$.

The predicted curve is produced by dividing the amplitude spectral density of
the shot noise on the detection photodiode ($A_{shot})$ by the optical gain of
the interferometer ($S_{DC}$). The DC optical gain is (as derived earlier) simply
the derivative of the power at the output port with respect to changes in
differential arm length, evaluated at the operating DARM offset:
%
\begin{align}
A_{shot}(f) &= \sqrt{2 h (c/\lambda) P_{AS}} \\
S_{DC}(f) &= 2 \sqrt{\epsilon P_{IN} P_{AS}}\ g_{cr}\ r_c'\ k\left(1 + i f/f_c\right)^{-1}
\end{align}
%
where $f_c = \nu_0 / (2\mathcal{F})$ is the cavity pole, $h$ is Planck's
constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.  This expression for $S_{DC}$ is in the single-pole
approximation, which is valid for frequencies much lower than the arm cavities'
free spectral range ($f\ll \nu_0)$, and for frequencies above the test mass
suspension's pendulum resonance (which may be increased due to radiation
pressure).

Combining these two expressions gives the noise floor due to shot noise,
calibrated in meters; dividing by the arm length $L$ gives the noise floor in strain:
%
\begin{align}
x_{shot}(f) & = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda h c}{2 \epsilon P_{IN}}}\ \frac{1}{g_{cr}\ r_c'}
\ \left|1 + i \frac{f}{f_c}\right| \\
h_{shot}(f) &= (1/L)\ x_{shot}(f)
\label{eq:expected-shot-noise}
\end{align}
%
The shot noise seen at the photodiode has a white spectrum; the entire shape of
the shot noise when calibrated as a displacement or strain comes from the
calibration (i.e. the optical gain) which in turn is shaped only by the cavity
pole.  Interferometers using signal recycling will have a more complicated
response function.

\subsection{Measured and Expected Sensitivity}
The measured detector noise floors, calibrated as a displacement amplitude
spectral density ($m/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$), along with the expected performance
based on equation~\ref{eq:expected-shot-noise} and measured detector parameters,
are depicted in figure~\ref{fig:shot-noise-limited-sensitivity}.  The measured
spectra were taken near the time of the detectors' best performance in
summer 2010.  The parameters used in the model are given in
table~\ref{tab:ifo-properties}.  

The comparison reveals that the achieved performance is as expected.  However,
some comments are in order: The H1 detector was able to operate with about twice
as much input power as the L1 detector, and had a power recycling gain
approximately 40\% better than L1's; from this we would expect considerably
better shot noise level at H1.  However, the H1 detector also experienced
anomalously low transmission of the arm cavity mode through the output mode
cleaner which contributed to a power efficiency ($\epsilon$) much lower than
desired.  The poor OMC transmission was due to some combination of poor
mode-matching, and high cavity losses which appeared near the end of the science
run.  These anomalous losses are not understood and are, as of the time of
writing, under active investigation.

\section{Laser and Oscillator Noise Coupling Mechanisms}


To compute the frequency response of the interferometer and the
expected laser and oscillator noise couplings, we first calculate the
amplitudes of the static fields at all points in the interferometer,
and then we compute the propagation of small GW signal or noise fields
through the interferometer.  In general, the small amplitude fields
due to GW waves or noises appear in the photodiode signals by beating
against the strong static fields, i.e. the laser carrier or the RF
sidebands.  In other words, the strong laser carrier field or RF
sidebands act as local oscillators not just for the intended
GW-induced sidebands, but audio-frequency (AF) sidebands introduced
through other mechanisms too, including AF sidebands that originate on
the light at the input to the interferometer.  These noises originating
at the input are the subject of this section.

Generically, we refer to any spectral line as a `sideband'. For the
purpose of analysis, 
sidebands are divided into radio-frequency (RF) sidebands and
audio-frequency (AF) sidebands. The distinction is not actually the
frequency of the lines but their magnitude; RF sidebands have some
finite amplitude, while audio-frequency sidebands are infinitessimal.
When the electric field is incident upon a photodiode, the photodiode
will see a beat signal between every pair of sidebands.  In our
formalism we make the approximation that the product of any two
audio-frequency sidebands is zero.  Audio-frequency sidebands are used
simply as test fields to evaluate linear transfer functions.  They
produce signals at PDs by beating against the finite-amplitude RF
sidebands.

As detailed in the preceeding chapter, the state of the LIGO interferometer is
determined by sampling the electric field at various ports using photodiodes.
Pairs of RF sidebands at several distinct frequencies are introduced at the
input to the interferometer; interference between these various fields allows
the state of the interferometer to be determined.  Around the laser carrier,
there are two pairs of RF sidebands, each produced through phase modulation: the
\emph{resonant sideband} at $\sim$25 MHz, which enters the interferometer and
emerges at the output port; and the \emph{non-resonant sideband} at $\sim$61
MHz, which is mostly reflected by the power recycling mirror.

For an intuitive understanding of the noise couplings to DC readout, we will
consider only the resonant sideband, an ignore the residual non-resonant
sideband.  In numerical simulations, both are included.  The arrangement of RF
sidebands is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:af-sidebands}.

Sidebands are typically created in pairs around a modulated the parent field;
and, when incident on a photodiode, they are most conveniently treated in pairs
too.  Instead of considering the amplitudes of upper and lower sidebands
separately, we can instead use a basis where we quantify the sidebands as some
amount of amplitude modulation (AM) and some amount of phase modulation.

  associated audio-frequency sidebands.}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Optickle}
Optickle\cite{Evans2007Optickle} is an interferometer simulation tool
developed by Matt Evans and implemented in Matlab.  Optickle uses the
first-order approximation described above, and also simulates the
effect of optomechanical couplings due to radiation pressure.
Optickle was used to make predictions of the laser and oscillator
noise couplings in Enhanced LIGO.  Optickle was extended to include
the effects of couplings due to servo controls systems by Lisa
Barsotti, Nicol\'as Smith, and myself.

\subsection{Laser Noises}

The Michelson-based design of laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors
is attractive due to its high common mode noise rejection.  A Michelson
interferometer with identical arms would completely isolate the output port from
common-mode noises (i.e. noise introduced at the input port).  Any asymmetries
between the arms will introduce couplings of noises at the input port to the
output port.  Some such asymmetries are unintentional, such as the difference in
finesse or reflectivity of the arms; intentional DARM and MICH asymmetries are
introduced in order to allow the local oscillator (RF or carrier) to read the
output port.

\subsubsection{Laser Intensity Noise}

Coupling of laser intensity noise to the output port is one of the easiest
couplings to understand.  The dominant mechanims (in the absence of radiation
pressure effects) are:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Below the coupled-cavity pole ($f_{cc}\approx 1$ Hz), carrier power
  fluctuations are transmitted directly to the output port, attenuated only by
  the ratio $P_{AS}/P_{IN}$.  Above the coupled cavity pole, transmission of AM
  on the carrier is attenuated by $1/f$.
\item The resonant RF sidebands and any modulation they carry reaches the output
  port attenuated only slightly, since the Michelson is arranged (via the
  Schnupp asymmetry) to conduct the RF sidebands to the output port.  Because
  the RF sidebands are not resonant in the arms, noise on the RF sidebands is
  not attenuated by the coupled-cavity pole; instead they see a much lower
  finesse power recycling cavity and transmission is essentially flat in the
  band of interest.  Once reaching the output port, however, the RF sidebands
  are strongly attenuated by the OMC.
\end{itemize}
At low frequency, the carrier contribution dominates; at higher
frequency the residual RF sidebands dominate.  This is depicted in
figure~\ref{fig:laser-AM-contributions}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{notes/figures/srcam_contributions.pdf}
\caption[Components of laser intensity noise contribution to DC readout]{\label{fig:laser-AM-contributions}Direct contributions of
  amplitude modulation of the laser carrier and RF sidebands to DC
  readout, in the absence of radiation pressure.  The carrier
  contribution is shaped by the coupled cavity pole.  The RF
  contribution is due to residual off-resonance transmission through
  the OMC.  Interference between the two coupling mechanisms creates a
  dip in the total coupling at the crossover frequency.}
\end{figure}

Laser intensity noise creates a varying radiation pressure force in the arm
cavities, which in turn causes displacement noise.  To distinguish this effect
from the inherent \emph{quantum} radiation pressure
noise\cite{Caves1980QuantumMechanical}, we refer to this as \emph{technical}
radiation pressure noise.  For identical arm cavities, the effect would be
entirely common mode.  Differences in arm cavity finesse and (especially) the
intentional differential detuning of the arm cavities produce a (potentially
large\cite{ChaibiOptomechanical}) coupling of technical radiation pressure noise
to DARM.

\subsubsection{Laser Frequency Noise}

Frequency modulation of a field incident on a photodiode will produce
no signal; in order for frequency modulation of the interferometer
input field to couple to the DC readout photodiode signal, the
frequency modulation must be converted to amplitude modulation as the
fields travel from the interferometer input to its output.  FM to AM
conversion is accomplished by rotating sidebands differentially or by
rotating the parent carrier, which occurs due to asymmetries between
the arms, including the intentional DARM offset (for DC readout), the
intentional Michelson (Schnupp) asymmetry, and differences in finesse
and losses in the two arms.

\subsection{Oscillator Noises}

Reduced coupling of noises from the RF oscillator is one of the
motivations for implementing DC readout. Despite not relying on the RF
sidebands directly, behavior of the RF oscillator is still able to
enter into the DC readout signal through control loop cross-couplings,
leakage of RF sideband power through the OMC, and amplitude modulation
of the laser carrier induced via AM on the RF oscillator.

\subsubsection{Oscillator AM}

Amplitude fluctuations of the RF oscillator produce a fluctuating modulation
depth; when the RF oscillator signal fluctuates upwards, more power is diverted
from the carrier into the RF sidebands.  The result is somewhat similar to laser
AM, except that carrier AM and RF AM are anti-correlated instead of correlated.

Unlike laser AM, oscillator AM does not produce equal relative intensity noise
(RIN) variations of the carrier and sidebands; this is simply because oscillator
AM results in equal and opposite changes of power in the carrier and sideband
rather than linear scalings of both.  The sideband RIN per oscillator AM is
given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\text{SB RIN}}{\text{OSC AM}}=2\Gamma_{0}\frac{J_{1}'(\Gamma_{0})}{J_{1}(\Gamma_{0})}=\Gamma_{0}\frac{J_{0}-J_{2}}{J_{1}}
\end{equation}
%(see Livingston elog 2010-07-15, {}``sideband RIN per oscillator AM calculation,'' ).
where $\Gamma_0$ is the nominal modulation depth, $J_n(z)$ is the $n$th Bessel
function, and $J_n'(z)=(\partial/\partial z)J_n(z)$ is the derivative of the Bessel function.

\subsubsection{Oscillator Phase Noise}

Phase noise on the RF oscillator produces phase noise on the resulting
RF sidebands, but does not affect the laser carrier.  Its direct
coupling to DC readout is therefore quite small; to couple to DC
readout, the phase noise sidebands must be converted to AM through
Michelson asymmetries, and then survive attentuation by the OMC.

\section{Laser and Oscillator Noise Coupling Measurements}

Laser and oscillator noise couplings were measured at both the H1 and
L1 detectors\footnote{Measurements at Hanford were made by Nicol\'as
  Smith.}, at a selection of DARM offsets.  In this section I explain
how the measurements were made and discuss the results.

\subsection{Laser Noise Coupling Measurements}

The LIGO laser source contains an intensity stabilization servo (ISS)
which reduces the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the laser power
before the laser enters the interferometer.  Injecting an excitation
into the error point of this servo impresses intensity noise onto the
beam.  The laser intensity noise coupling was measured by taking
synchronous swept-sine transfer functions from a monitor photodiode
just after the ISS and the DARM readout.

\begin{figure}[]   % Laser AM

\end{figure}

The laser frequency is stabilized to the mean length of the two arms
(CARM) by a high-bandwidth analog servo, the common mode servo.
Frequency modulation can be induced by injecting into the error point
of this servo.  Unlike with the ISS, there is no separate witness
sensor to provide a direct measurement of the induced laser frequency
modulation.  Instead we must make a calibration of the common mode
servo error point.  The frequency noise coupling is to be calibrated
in terms of Hz of frequency noise \emph{before} the stabilizing action
of the common mode servo, so we must account for the suppression of
the loop.  The calibration was done by porting the calibration of DARM
to CARM, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Drive the position of one of the end test masses (ETMs) with a
  sinusoidal modulation at some probe frequency ($f=7300$ Hz was
  used).  In the absence of loops, this would produce equal DARM and
  CARM motion.
\item Measure the response in the DARM and CARM readouts.  The CARM
  readout channel is REFL\_I, which senses the mismatch between the
  laser carrier frequency and the CARM length.
\item Apply the DARM calibration.  This includes compensation for the
  DARM control loop.
\item Compensate for the frequency noise suppression of the common
  mode loop by multiplying by $1+G$ where $G$ is the (complex) open
  loop gain of the common mode loop at the probe frequency.
\item Equate the calibrated DARM and loop-corrected CARM.  This gives
  a calibration for CARM in meters at the probe frequency.
\item Multiply by $\delta\nu/\delta L = \nu/L = c/(\lambda L)$ to
  convert from meters to Hz.
\item Assume a model for the CARM to REFL\_I transfer function to
  propagate the calibration to other frequencies.  This transfer
  function is simply the coupled-cavity pole\cite[eq. 3.5]{RanaThesis}.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Discussion}
In general, the measured laser noise couplings are much higher than
the expectations from the Optickle models.  The most likely
explanation for this disagreement is that the Optickle models include
only plane-wave effects; there is no modeling of higher order spatial
modes, imperfect mode-matching, etc.  The experience with the
difficulty of designing an effective alignment servo for the OMC
demonstrates the importance of these higher-order modes.  Any
deviation from perfect alignment of the interferometer itself or the
beam into the OMC will lead to coupling of spurious higher-order modes
from the power-recycling cavity into the OMC, leading to excess laser
noise coupling.  These modes are not resonant in the arms so would not
experience filtering by the coupled-cavity pole, leading to a
broadband increase in the coupling, as observed.  To explore this
hypothesis, more modeling should be conducted, using a tool which can
model higher-order spatial modes.

\subsection{Oscillator Noise Coupling Measurements}

To measure oscillator noise couplings we temporarily switched the
source of the 25 MHz oscillator from the Wenzel crystal oscillator to
a general purpose (IFR 2023A) RF function generator, which accepts
phase and amplitude modulation inputs.  The measurements were made by
connecting a spare DAC output to the modulation input of the IFR
function generator and then taking synchronous swept-sine transfer
functions from the modulation drive to the DC readout with the
interferometer in its running configuration.

To calibrate the oscillator AM transfer function, we configured the
interferometer optics (by misaligning unneeded mirrors) to send a
fraction of the input light directly to the OMC and locked the OMC to
one of the RF sidebands.  Taking the transfer function in this
configuration allowed a direct measurement of the AM imposed on the RF
sidebands\footnote{Thank you to Robert Ward for suggesting the
  technique.}.  To calibrate the oscillator PM transfer function, a
curve with the same shape as the AM calibration was used, but with the
DC value determined by the front panel setting of the phase modulation
depth on the function generator.  This was checked separately at a few
individual frequencies by connecting the output of the function
generator directly to an RF spectrum analyzer.

The measured oscillator AM coupling is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:osc-AM}.  The level of the coupling is well described
by the Optickle model.  Phase noise coupling measurements are given in
figure~\ref{fig:osc-PM}, compared with measurements made in initial
LIGO's RF readout\cite{Smith2005Oscillator}.  We see a distinct
(factor of 10) advantage of DC readout over RF readout.

\caption[Example of linear and bilinear beam jitter
  coupling]{\label{fig:jitter-mechanism}Example of linear and bilinear
  beam jitter coupling in the L1 OMC.  Left: the light incident on the
  OMC shows motion at $\sim 130$ Hz (arbitrary units).  Center: the incident light
  contains intensity modulations at $\sim 0.87$ and $\sim 1.6$
  Hz (units: $\log_{10} (\delta{}P/P)$). Right: the light transmitted through the OMC contains intensity
  modulations at $130$ Hz, $130 \pm 0.87$ Hz, and $ 130 \pm 1.6$ Hz (units: $\log_{10} (\delta{}P/P)$).
  (The sources of the incident beam motion and intensity fluctuations
  have not been identified.)}
\end{figure}
Beam jitter is perhaps the most important new noise source introduced
in the DC readout system.  The cavity converts motion of the incident
beam into amplitude modulation, which pollutes the readout.  In the
ideal case, this would be a quadratic effect, but the presence of
spurious higher order modes introduces both linear and bilinear contributions.

We have several means of controlling the beam jitter contribution to the
readout.  In practice, we utilize all of them:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Remove mechanical resonances and increase isolation.}  Several
  prominent beam-jitter peaks in the readout spectrum were removed by
  replacing a fixed steering mirror with a suspended one; and by
  adding blade-springs to the steering mirrors for additional vertical isolation.

\item \emph{Cancel the motion.}  Motion at the 60 Hz power-line
  frequency is introduced via magnetic coupling to the magnets used to
  actuate on the suspended steering mirrors.  We implemented a feed-forward
  correction using signals derived from a magnetometer located just outside
  the vacuum chamber.

\item \emph{Place steering optics where their coupling to beam jitter
  is small.}
  Beam propagation geometry can magnify the effects of optic motion to 
  beam motion.
  For a given amount of optic jitter, the coupling to readout noise can
  be reduced by proper design of the mode-matching telescope.
  This constraint is at odds with the desire for maximum controllability
  of the input beam pointing.  
  In practice the requirement is that sufficient actuation range be 
  provided, and that the optics be well separated in Gouy phase to
  create a non-degenerate control matrix.

\item \emph{Reshape the beam.}  Linear beamjitter coupling arises due
  to the presence of carrier-mode junk light in the HG01 mode incident
  on the mode cleaner.  The transmission of this light through the OMC
  is linearly dependent on the position of the incident beam.  By
  introducing offsets into the interferometer's global angular sensing
  and control (ASC) system\cite{Barsotti2010Alignment}, this HG01 mode light can be cancelled out,
  nulling the linear sensitivity to beam motion.
  During Enhanced LIGO this was found to be a highly effective
  technique, but it was not automated.
\end{itemize}

An example of the observed beam jitter coupling is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:jitter-mechanism}.  A prominent spectral line at
$\sim130$ Hz appears in quadrant photodiode (QPD) signal, indicating
relative motion in yaw between the incident beam and the OMC.  This
line also appears in the signal of the light transmitted through the
OMC, indicating some linear coupling of beam jitter to transmission.
The transmitted spectrum also contains sidebands around the 130 Hz
line at separations of $\pm0.875$ Hz and $\pm1.6$ Hz which arise due
to gain modulation.

\section{Optical Spring}
%
Detuning the arm cavities from their resonance introduces a big optical
spring.

\begin{equation}
k_{opt}\approx\frac{64\mathcal{F}^{2}g^{2}P_{IN}}{c\lambda^{2}}\left(\delta x\right) 
\end{equation}

\section{Technical Radiation Pressure Noise}

Amplitude noise on the input laser field produces modulation radiation
pressure on the optics, in particular in the arm cavities.  If the arm
cavities were identical, this coupling would be entirely common mode.
However, once the arms are differentially detuned, the radiation
pressure noise attains a differential component.

We can treat the radiation pressure noise as a displacement noise.

Suppose the arm cavities are initially identical, with all 
suspensions having resonant frequency $\omega_0$.  The optical spring
shifts this resonance to $\omega_0 \pm \delta\omega$.

The intensity noise to displacement transfer function is
\begin{equation}
  P_{IN} {g_{rc}}^2 {g_{cav}}^2 \frac{1}{s_{cc}} 
\end{equation}

\section{Digital Effects}

The realtime digital signal processing system through which our
control systems are implemented provide the illusion of a continuous,
analog system.  However, it is important to remember that the
underlying system operates on quantized values in discrete time in
order to avoid being caught by surprise by ``digital noises''.

\begin{itemize}
\item Finite, non-deterministic execution time
\item ADC bit noise
\item Floating point dynamic range
\item Synchronized communications
