\chapter{DC Readout}
\label{chapter3}

The initial LIGO detectors used RF heterodyne detection, inspired by
the Pound-Drever-Hall technique, to sense all interferometer length
degrees of freedom and most angular degrees of freedom.  During
Enhanced LIGO, the sensing of the gravitational wave channel (DARM)
was changed to a form of homodyne detection called DC readout.  In
this chapter I explain the motivation for and theory behind DC
readout.

\section{Principle of DC readout}
A homodyne readout system differs from a heterodyne system by using a
local oscillator at the same (optical) frequency as the field we wish
to measure.  In DC readout we bring this 

DC readout creates a homodyne local oscillator by putting a small
offset into the Michelson or DARM degree of freedom, moving the
interferometer slightly off of the DARM fringe at DC.  In this
``fringe'' view, the operation is very simple to understand: moving
off of the null point introduces a non-zero first derivative.  

The true beauty of this technique is that it exploits the filtering
action of the compound interferometer to produce the local oscillator;
any fluctuations in the amplitude or frequency of the input laser
field are attenuated by the coupled cavity pole before reaching the
output port.

\section{Motivation for DC readout}

Some of the motivations of DC readout and an output mode cleaner are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The filtering action of the compound interferometer produces an
  extremely quiet local oscillator.  This reduces the coupling of
  laser noises to the readout.
\item Contributions from noise on the electronic oscillator used to
  create the RF sidebands are greatly reduced.
\item The shot-noise-limited sensitivity of homodyne detection is
  inherently better than that of heterodyne detection, for a fixed
  amount of power on the detection photodiodes, by a factor of at
  least $\sqrt{3/2}$.
\item The shot noise level may be further reduced through the
  injection of squeezed quantum vacuum.  This is much more technically
  feasible with homodyne detection than heterodyne detection.  This
  has recently been demonstrated at the GEO600 detector and a
  prototype implementation is underway at Hanford.
\item In DC readout, the signal field and the local oscillator are
  guaranteed to have perfect spatial overlap, since they come from the
  same place.  By contrast, in the conventional heterodyne
  arrangement, the RF fields and the carrier are resonant in different
  cavities and may occupy slightly different spatial modes.  This
  leads to a reduction of shot-noise-limited SNR.  (However, an output
  mode cleaner can be used to force good overlap in either case.)
\item The output mode cleaner greatly decreases the amount of power
  that must be detected by the detection photodiodes by removing
  spurious higher order modes.    
\end{itemize}

  and RF readouts.  (a) In RF readout, the laser carrier is suppressed
  by operating the Michelson on a dark fringe for the carrier.
  Differential phase modulation in the arms becomes amplitude
  modulation of the (suppressed) carrier, depicted as the
  audio-frequency sidebands at $\pm f_{gw}$.  The photodiode sees a
  beat between the GW signal and the RF sidebands.  In homodyne
  readout, a carrier-frequency local oscillator is introduced--in DC
  readout this is done by introducing a microscopic asymmetry between
  the two arms.  The RF sidebands are no longer needed and are removed
  by the output mode cleaner.  The GW-induced sidebands appear as
  amplitude modulation on the carrier, which is sensed directly by the
  photodiodes.}

  Michelson.  DARM motion causes equal but opposite rotation of the
  two phasors, which modulates the amplitude of the resultant electric
  field at the AS port ($E_{AS}$).  If this field has a nonzero
  nominal value, as in DC readout, then this will also result in
  linear modulation of $P_{AS}$.}

\subsection{Calculation of the optical gain}

The ratio of signal produced (in Watts) to displacement of DARM (in
meters) is the \emph{optical gain}.  In DC readout, we can find the
optical gain for slow DARM variations by simply taking the derivative
of the power at the anti-symmetric port with respect to changes in
DARM.

From the prior chapter, take the expression for the power at the
output of a Michelson:
\begin{equation}
P_{AS} = \frac{1}{4}P_{BS}\left( {r_+}^2 \sin^2 \phi_- + {r_-}^2 \cos^2 \phi_-\right)
\end{equation}
Neglecting the difference in reflectivity, we have simply
\begin{equation}
P_{AS} = P_{BS} \sin^2 137 k x
\end{equation}
where $k=2\pi/\lambda$ is the wavenumber, $x$ is the DARM displacement, and $137$ is the phase gain.
Taking the derivative, we find the optical gain
\begin{align}
S_{DC}  & = \frac{\partial P_{AS}}{\partial x}  \\
       & = 2 P_{BS} \sin (137 k x) \cos(137 k x) 137 k \\
       & = 2\cdot 137 k \sqrt{P_{BS} P_{AS}} \cos(137 k x)
\end{align}
The cosine term is very near unity and can be neglected.  Also, the
phase gain dies off with the cavity pole; and $P_{BS}$ is related to
the input power $P_{IN}$ via the power recycling gain ${g_{cr}}^2$.
Putting this together, we get:
\begin{equation}
S_{DC}(f) = 2 g_{cr} \sqrt{P_{IN} P_{AS}} \left(\frac{r_c'}{r_c}\right) \left(1 + i\frac{f}{f_c}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}

%% To the extent that the introduction of DC offset simply creates a
%% nonzero carrier field at the output port and does not otherwise affect
%% the interferometer dynamics, the frequency response of the interferometer
%% is the same in DC readout as in heterodyne readout, except for an
%% overall scaling. This can be seen by considering the sideband picture
%% (see Figure \ref{fig:sideband-picture}) and is borne out by the following
%% derivation.%

We see that the optical gain scales with the square root of both input
power and the power at the AS port (assuming that the power recycling
gain $g_{cr}$ remains constant, which is approximately true for small
offsets).  From this we can conclude several properties of DC readout
immediately:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the optical gain and the shot noise ASD both scale with
  $P_{AS}$, the shot-noise-limited sensitivity is insensitive to the
  particular DARM offset we use.
\item The sensitivity of the detector improves with the square root of
  the input power.
\item The frequency response of the interferometer is the same in DC
  readout as in RF readout, up to a scaling factor. (Both are shaped
  simply by the cavity pole.)
\end{itemize}
%
As long as the DARM offset is sufficiently small, the degradation of
power recycling is negligible.

  motion. The lower trace shows the residual motion of DARM after
  stabilization by the DARM control loop.  The upper trace shows the
  `calibrated' DARM, in which the effect of the control loop has been
  removed by multiplying by $(1+G)$, where $G$ is the open loop gain;
  this can be interpreted as `the motion that would be there if there
  were no control loop.'  The control loop reduces the RMS DARM motion
  by ten orders of magnitude in order to hold the interferometer
  within the linear regime around the operating point.  The DARM
  offset used to implement DC readout must be significantly larger
  than the RMS residual motion ($\sim10^{-14}$ m) to avoid fringe
  wrapping and nonlinearity.}

\subsection{Decrease in arm power due to off-resonance operation}

The decrease in buildup for a cavity operated off-resonance goes like
$(2\mathcal{F}/\pi)^2\phi^2$, where $\phi$ is the cavity detuning.
For $\mathcal{F}=220$ and $\phi=(2\pi/1064\text{ nm})(10\text{ pm})$,
the fractional power loss is only $7\times10^{-5}$.

\subsection{Decrease in power recycling gain due to power loss at the output port}

Allowing power to escape the power recycling cavity (PRC) through the
AS port effectively increases the losses of the PRC, diminishing the
power recycling gain.

The carrier power in the PRC is given by
\begin{equation}
P_{BS} = P_{IN}\left| \frac{t_{RM}}{1 - r_{RM} r_{IFO}}\right|^2
\end{equation}
where $t_{RM}$ is the amplitude transmissivity of the recycling
mirror, $r_{RM}$ is its reflectivity, and $r_{IFO}$ is the amplitude
reflectivity of the rest of the Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer.
The power-recycling cavity is designed to be critically coupled, so
$r_{IFO}\approx r_{RM}$.

With a DC offset in place, the reflectivity of the Michelson becomes $r_M = r_{IFO}\cos\phi_-$, so we can write
\begin{equation}
P_{BS}(\delta x) \approx P_{IN} 
\frac{T_{RM}}{\left(1 - R_{RM} \cos\left(2\cdot137\cdot k\cdot\delta x\right)\right)^2}
\end{equation}
The loss of power recycling gain becomes significant for large
offsets.  For a 10 pm offset, the reduction in power recycling gain is
only 1\%, but for a 50 pm offset it grows to 20\%.

\subsection{DC readout elsewhere}
DC readout has been implemented previously at the Caltech 40 meter
prototype \cite{Ward2008DC,RobWardThesis} and the GEO 600
detector\cite{GeoDC,Prijatelj2010,Degallaix2010Commissioning}.  The
current configuration of Virgo incorporates an output mode cleaner but
uses RF heterodyne readout\cite{Acernese2008Virgo}.

  old RF heterodyne output chain, used for lock acquisition and
  automatic alignment.}
